## Cupping After Roast

Below are methods to check roast quality

### #QC1 Cupping 24-48 Hours

Status: Not in use

- Aromas of beans and fines are maintained
- Flavours are not accurate when beans have rested and ready to brew
- Do not indicate roast flavours in light-medium roasts despite being present in brew
- Time consuming as need secure time for next day to cup (working life pain zzz)

### #QC2 Cupping After Roast

Fines are left outside for 6 hours before cupping

Status: Experimenting now

- Dry aromas will be weak
- Flavours are present and clear (testing if brew will be impacted)
- Easier to allocate time (especially weekends)
